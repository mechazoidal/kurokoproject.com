That same year, [Gundam Extreme Vs.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mobile_Suit_Gundam:_Extreme_Vs.&oldid=804923962)></a>(or alternately, Gundam EXVS) was released to arcades and PS3.

In 2017, Gundam VS [was released to the US on PS4](https://www.polygon.com/guides/2017/10/6/16432362/gundam-versus-beginners-guide-controls-characters-attacks-movement)>.

[Juro Watari is laughing all the way to the bank](http://www.4gamer.net/games/374/G037408/20180201092/), and in the end the principles of Virtual On won the long-game.
