### At the end of the show, people change, but they don't leave

### You were once the main attraction, but now that's in the past
That same year, [Gundam Extreme Vs.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mobile_Suit_Gundam:_Extreme_Vs.&oldid=804923962)(or alternately, Gundam EXVS) was released to arcades and PS3. As [these](https://twitter.com/sasuraiger/status/857798863746453509)&nbsp;[three](https://twitter.com/sasuraiger/status/857799682986303488)&nbsp;[tweets](https://twitter.com/sasuraiger/status/857800315692871682) illustrate: by adapting simplified movement controls from Dreamcast 3D games and perfecting team-play through the Cost system, it became the [true Virtual On successor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR_t86bIcX8).

In 2017, Gundam VS [was released to the US on PS4](https://www.polygon.com/guides/2017/10/6/16432362/gundam-versus-beginners-guide-controls-characters-attacks-movement). And [Senko no Ronde 2 is on Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/574160/Senko_no_Ronde_2/) with [VOOT characters as DLC](http://steamcommunity.com/games/574160/announcements/detail/1458465546793211143).

### When the streets are quiet, we'll walk out in the silence
[Juro Watari is laughing all the way to the bank](http://www.4gamer.net/games/374/G037408/20180201092/), and in the end the principles of Virtual On won the long-game.

...Even if we do have to put up with the monkey's-paw of [A Certain Magical Virtual On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAlJ9qhr2wA).
