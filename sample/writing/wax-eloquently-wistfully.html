      <p><a href="http://health.tommusic.net/2011/04/im-so-sorry-to-tell-you/">On April 17th, 2011, Tom Music passed away.</a></p>
      <p>Tom was a friend gained through repeated attendance of the <a href="http://auburnvo.org/">Auburn Virtual-On Crew</a> during its heyday in the early 2000’s. A dynamite Raiden player and expert with prediction lasers, he was usually at least a <a href="http://www.sirlin.net/articles/yomi-layer-3-knowing-the-mind-of-the-opponent.html">yomi layer</a> above you. He had the knack of predicting where a situation was likely to be going, and making sure all available witticisms were extracted. And no matter the situation, it would be made witty: his archived <a href="http://waxeloquently.com/">personal blog</a> is shades of exploration alternated with childlike fascination, backed by humor drier than Winston Churchill’s martinis.</p>
      <p>That sense of humor and love of a good situation dovetailed into one of his websites, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150721033450/http://obeythedecider.com/wa/seattle">Obey the Decider</a> . Tom was busy describing it at the last Auburn Virtual-On Crew tourney in 2009, as he had just come off of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghgu-Hi84S0">Seattle Startup Weekend 2</a>, where he’d pitched the idea. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mechazoidal/3400935614">While he was waiting for his turn</a> to demolish us with Screw Lasers, he noted that the hidden goal was to ‘randomly’ suggest the same place to groups of users based on time, to get people together in a fun location with a common talking point. That was pure Tom—he was always having a great time and wanted to make sure other people were having just as much fun.</p>
      <p>That tourney however, was the last time I physically saw him. His lymphoma was diagnosed three months later. However, he kept everyone up to date using social media and his dedicated health blog <a href="http://health.tommusic.net">Lymphomartini</a>. After getting a smartphone, I followed his Twitter stream during his <a href="http://health.tommusic.net/2010/01/catching-up/">cut-short trip to England</a>, and his speedy recovery back home.</p>
      <p>During his early remission in 2009, he managed to get to a public gaming center with the just-released XBLA version of VOOT. He had to use a generic gamertag with no microphone, but we knew who each of us were. I hope that I gave him at least a few good matches like in the old days.</p>
      <p>All of these experiences culminated in Tom’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8a8eV_5Yb8">legendary Ignite Seattle talk</a> , using his rich voice and copious sense of humor to make light of his experiences.</p>
      <p>Less than a year after that talk, he isn’t with us anymore. But he never stopped fighting, never stopped encouraging others, and <a href="http://health.tommusic.net/2011/04/hunting-and-pecking-again/">never lost his sense of humor.</a></p>
      <p>As good friends of mine have said: I want to be Tom Music when I grow up.</p>
