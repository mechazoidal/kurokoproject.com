[On April 17th, 2011, Tom Music passed
away.](http://health.tommusic.net/2011/04/im-so-sorry-to-tell-you/)

Tom was a friend gained through repeated attendance of the [Auburn
Virtual-On Crew](http://auburnvo.org/) during its heyday in the early
2000’s. A dynamite Raiden player and expert with prediction lasers, he
was usually at least a [yomi
layer](http://www.sirlin.net/articles/yomi-layer-3-knowing-the-mind-of-the-opponent.html)
above you. He had the knack of predicting where a situation was likely
to be going, and making sure all available witticisms were extracted.
And no matter the situation, it would be made witty: his archived
[personal blog](http://waxeloquently.com/) is shades of exploration
alternated with childlike fascination, backed by humor drier than
Winston Churchill’s martinis.

That sense of humor and love of a good situation dovetailed into one of
his websites, [Obey the Decider](http://obeythedecider.com) . Tom was
busy describing it at the last Auburn Virtual-On Crew tourney in 2009,
as he had just come off of [Seattle Startup Weekend
2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghgu-Hi84S0), where he’d pitched the
idea. [While he was waiting for his
turn](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mechazoidal/3400935614) to demolish
us with Screw Lasers, he noted that the hidden goal was to ‘randomly’
suggest the same place to groups of users based on time, to get people
together in a fun location with a common talking point. That was pure
Tom—he was always having a great time and wanted to make sure other
people were having just as much fun.

That tourney however, was the last time I physically saw him. His
lymphoma was diagnosed three months later. However, he kept everyone up
to date using social media and his dedicated health blog
[Lymphomartini](http://health.tommusic.net). After getting a smartphone,
I followed his Twitter stream during his [cut-short trip to
England](http://health.tommusic.net/2010/01/catching-up/), and his
speedy recovery back home.

During his early remission in 2009, he managed to get to a public gaming
center with the just-released XBLA version of VOOT. He had to use a
generic gamertag with no microphone, but we knew who each of us were. I
hope that I gave him at least a few good matches like in the old days.

All of these experiences culminated in Tom’s [legendary Ignite Seattle
talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8a8eV_5Yb8) , using his rich voice
and copious sense of humor to make light of his experiences.

Less than a year after that talk, he isn’t with us anymore. But he never
stopped fighting, never stopped encouraging others, and [never lost his
sense of
humor.](http://health.tommusic.net/2011/04/hunting-and-pecking-again/)

As good friends of mine have said: I want to be Tom Music when I grow
up.
