## Wax eloquently, wistfully
<time datetime="2011-04-20Z05:00:00">2011/04/20</time>

[On April 17th, 2011, Tom Music passed away.](http://health.tommusic.net/2011/04/im-so-sorry-to-tell-you/)

Tom was a friend gained through repeated attendance of the [Auburn Virtual-On Crew](http://auburnvo.org/)during its heyday in the early 2000’s. A dynamite Raiden player and expert with prediction lasers, he was usually at least a [yomi layer](http://www.sirlin.net/articles/yomi-layer-3-knowing-the-mind-of-the-opponent.html)above you. He had the knack of predicting where a situation was likely to be going, and making sure all available witticisms were extracted. And no matter the situation, it would be made witty: his archived [personal blog](http://waxeloquently.com/)is shades of exploration alternated with childlike fascination, backed by humor drier than Winston Churchill’s martinis.

That sense of humor and love of a good situation dovetailed into one of his websites, [Obey the Decider](https://web.archive.org/web/20150721033450/http://obeythedecider.com/wa/seattle). Tom was busy describing it at the last Auburn Virtual-On Crew tourney in 2009, as he had just come off of [Seattle Startup Weekend 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghgu-Hi84S0) where he’d pitched the idea. [While he was waiting for his turn](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mechazoidal/3400935614) to demolish us with Screw Lasers, he noted that the hidden goal was to ‘randomly’ suggest the same place to groups of users based on time, to get people together in a fun location with a common talking point. That was pure Tom--he was always having a great time and wanted to make sure other people were having just as much fun.

That tourney however, was the last time I physically saw him. His lymphoma was diagnosed three months later. However, he kept everyone up to date using social media and his dedicated health blog [Lymphomartini](http://health.tommusic.net) After getting a smartphone, I followed his Twitter stream during his [cut-short trip to England](http://health.tommusic.net/2010/01/catching-up/) and his speedy recovery back home.

During his early remission in 2009, he managed to get to a public gaming center with the just-released XBLA version of VOOT. He had to use a generic gamertag with no microphone, but we knew who each of us were. I hope that I gave him at least a few good matches like in the old days.

All of these experiences culminated in Tom’s [legendary Ignite Seattle talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8a8eV_5Yb8), using his rich voice and copious sense of humor to make light of his experiences.

Less than a year after that talk, he isn’t with us anymore. But he never stopped fighting, never stopped encouraging others, and [never lost his sense of humor.](http://health.tommusic.net/2011/04/hunting-and-pecking-again/)

As good friends of mine have said: I want to be Tom Music when I grow up.
