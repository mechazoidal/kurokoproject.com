[Billkwando](http://www.youtube.com/user/Billkwando): This is a great article. I actually posted it over at gfaqs for some of the nubcakes to peruse, since VO can be so damn complicated.

I still have my Saturn twinsticks (and my Netlink!) so I'm hoping to maybe mod them for 360, but still retain the Saturn functionality. I'm hoping that I can hook up some 360 controller guts directly to the microswitches, so the Saturn stuff is left untouched.

[s.f.](http://www.kurokoproject.com): Scott & Menthol: Thanks! I was afraid that I might have gotten some of the finer points mixed up, but both your seals of approval mean a lot to me! :)

Neal: Thanks for the kind words! I hope I didn't scare anybody away from at least giving the XBLA version a try with pads to see if they like it. After all, Sega at least loves us enough to reissue it..

Trevor: Haha, awesome! (I kept the shipping label for the longest time, I have no idea why) Those sticks are still sitting in my living room, and if Sega decides not to bring out 360 'sticks, I'll probably use them to build a 360-compatible version.

[Trevor Menagh](http://treveport.org/): That was an awesome article. I am looking forward to the XBLA re-release regardless, but having twin sticks would be cool.

I still remember the shop I bought your Twin Sticks from, right outside the Makino train station in Kyoto. :D

[Neal Taylor](): Whew! *applauds* Dude...this is a masterpiece. I am a controller player[but I plan on getting some sticks eventually]and i've always wondered why the sticks were such a big deal. I understand now. To truly live the game you need sticks...with a pad you're just playing it. Great article.

Scott, thanks!
